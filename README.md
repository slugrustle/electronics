# Electronics

This repository includes various electronics projects in a sufficient state of completion to publish informally.

HighImpedanceBuffer is a two&#x2011;channel unity gain buffer amplifier with high impedance inputs and a &#xb1;17.5V input range.

SOT23ZenerTester is a fixture and set of software that can be used to obtain the voltage / current curves of SOT23&#x2011;3 case Zener diodes when used in conjunction with other test equipment.

TestSequencer is a fairly simple board that surrounds an 8&#x2011;bit PIC microcontroller with a power supply, programming header, and various inputs and outputs through ESD protected terminal blocks. I use it for controlling other equipment and running tests.

HH509R\_Logger is a command line program to log temperature measurements from an Omega Engineering HH509R thermocouple reader.

## Getting Started

The README files the individual directories descibed above are a good place to start.

## Contributing

I would love to receive bug reports and user feedback. If you have improvements to the code, please get in touch.
