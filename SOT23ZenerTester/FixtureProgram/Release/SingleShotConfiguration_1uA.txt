# If only one Diolan device is attached to the test computer,
# that device will be used and this field will be ignored.

# The voltages and resistances below are set to get ~1uA
# Zener Current from 13V nominal Zeners in sockets J5L through
# J7L and the same from 18V nominal Zeners in sockets J7R
# through J9R.

# TEST_VOLTAGE is the voltage setting of the power supply before
# the Zener Socket Relay is closed. Make sure this is within the
# valid output range of your power supply. Additionally, this value
# must be on the range 0.001 to 1000.0 Volts.
#
# WARNING: the Single Shot Test does not attempt to estimate or
# limit power or current levels. Make sure the fixture resistors,
# fixture relays, and the Zener diodes under test will not be
# damaged by the applied voltage.
